# Why are you interested in this dataset?

I'm interested in this dataset because knowing about student performances can help institutions
create resources that can help students. Several factors contribute to how students perform academically 
and knowing how each can significantly impact performance.

This dataset came from [this kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devansodariya/student-performance-data). "Data for student performances with factors such as age, gender, time they spent studying."
